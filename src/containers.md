# Software Engineering Notes

## Containers

My experience with containers began in 2015 out of curiosity. I noticed this project called docker was showing up in many of the websites I used for googling software issues. So I went to the github page for the docker project and gave it a whirl.

### Docker

I played with containers over the next couple years. I practiced docker-compose, building images from scratch, docker networking, container management and a little orchestration here and there.

### LXC

Initially, I tried using LXC and was disappointed with the difficulty, but then LXD came along and abstracted out most of the complexity so that LXC feels more "docker-like".
