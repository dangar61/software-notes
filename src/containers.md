### Containers

My experience with containers began in 2015 out of curiosity. I noticed this project called docker was showing up in many of the websites I used for googling software issues. So I went to the github page for the docker project and gave it a whirl.

I played with containers over the next couple years. I practiced docker-compose, building images from scratch, docker networking, container management and a little orchestration here and there. 

In 2018, I joined a team using GitLab for their SCC and CI system. This is when I started using containers at work. I thought to myself, "Finally, an opportunity to really put containers to the test."
