# Software Engineering Notes.

### Languages

While there are a zillion different languages out there, the ones I will discuss here are the languages I use while working in an enterprise R&D lab. 

In my daily toil, sometimes I am coding embedded programs, sometimes I am coding for the cloud and sometimes I am coding for the desktop. You have to be very flexible in this modern programming age and you must know how to read and write code in multiple languages. Gone are the days of using only one language and becoming an expert in that one language. Now you have to have expertise in multiple languages and do a lot of context switching between tasks. 

Does this sound like fun? It all depends on your outlook. Personally, I love to learn, and this type of work allows me to learn more than my mind can hold. On the flip-side, this kind of work can be very frustrating. The old saying is, "There are no free lunches".
