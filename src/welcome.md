# Software Engineering Notes.

### Welcome. This is my COVID19 sanity project. I decided to share my experiences with everyone out there who wants to write software for a living.

### Quality = f(K,P,t)
     Where:
     K = Knowledge
     P = Practice
     t = talent

Many people say software quality is function of  talent. I disagree. Quality is a function of knowledge, practice and talent. If **K** and **P** are large values, the value of **t** is insignificant.
