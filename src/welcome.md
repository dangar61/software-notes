# Software Engineering Notes.

### Welcome. This is my COVID-19 sanity project. I decided to share my experiences with everyone out there who wants to write software for a living.

### Quality = f(K,P,T)
     Where:
     K = Knowledge
     P = Practice
     T = Talent

Do software engineers have to be talented? Well, software quality is a function of knowledge, practice and talent. As **K** and **P** grow, the value of **T** becomes less significant. So, in other words, if you gain experience, you can do the job even with low **T**.
