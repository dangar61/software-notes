### Windows Containers

---
Docker images for Windows containers are big. Doing anything with Windows containers is painful, especially if you are used to linux containers. There are multiple versions of images for all the versions of Windows that support docker. So many image versions that it is mind boggling. It is difficult to know which image to use for any given task. The price you have to pay in engineering time is not worth it. My advice. Don't use them. Ignore them.
