### Docker Extensions

---

One extension in vscode called "Remote-Containers". Allows you to spin up a full development environment in a container with a few mouse clicks. There are sample development environments for several different languages. Rust, C++, C#, Python and more. Custom development containers are also possible. This extension is already my favorite. :)

The extension's sample environments open to a starter project. In many cases you simply press F5 and you are running in a debugger.
