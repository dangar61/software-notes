### Rust

Rust is an interesting language. Memory safety without the overhead of a GC. I like that!

Rust's build and test tooling is very good and getting better all the time. I see a bright future for Rust.

Rust has the benefits of a compiled language with the tooling of an interpreted language. Very nice.

Becoming a productive Rust programmer is my goal for 2021 and while I write personal projects in Rust, I have yet to use it at work. My intention is to bring in a rust tool and show the team how it works. Maybe they will like it? Maybe they won't? You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink, right?

Rust Marketing:
 
* Things I don't like about Rust Marketing:
    * "Rust" is a negative word. Sounds old and no longer in good condition.
    * The crab mascot and the marketing around it seems childish.
* Things I like about Rust Marketing:
    * The "R in the gear logo".
