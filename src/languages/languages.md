## Languages

While there are a zillion different languages out there, the ones I will discuss here are the languages I use while working in an enterprise R&D lab.

In my daily work, sometimes I am working with embedded, sometimes with the web and sometimes with the desktop. Flexibility is the key in this modern programming age. Gone are the days of using only one language and becoming an expert in that one language. Now, programmers must to have some level of expertise in multiple languages.

Does this sound like fun? It all depends on your outlook. Personally, I love to learn, and this type of work allows me to learn more than my mind can hold. On the flip-side, this kind of work can be very frustrating. The old saying is, "There are no free lunches". For example, on Tuesday, I might be learning something new. On Wednesday, I might be frustrated to the point of giving up. The key is don't give up. Push through the frustration and come out on the other side, successful.
