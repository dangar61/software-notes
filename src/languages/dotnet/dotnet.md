# Software Engineering Notes

### C#

    Requires the CLR (Common Language Runtime)
    The overhead of a garbage collector (GC). 

While I don't consider C# a compiled language in the native sense, I use C# a lot at work. I have been programming full-time in C# for 15 years give or take. C# is very similar to Java and I found it fairly comfortable switching between the two.
